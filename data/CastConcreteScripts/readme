convertTo8bit:

Takes 16 bit volume (.raw File) as an input and scales it down to 8 bit. Therefore the Data size is halved.
Notice: Name of inpot file is hard - coded


mycast8to8smaller:

Takes an 8 bit Volume as an input, takes every sekond voxel in each direktion (x,y,z) so that the size is devided by eight. this improves performance of rendering.
Name and size are hard - coded. If you devide an xyz component, which is not devidable by 2, you have to round up (!)


mycastgeaveraged:

Takes an 8 bit Volume as an input and averages ober each n x n x n voxel (n is defined at the beginning, should not be snaller than 8 otherwise rounding problems occur)
